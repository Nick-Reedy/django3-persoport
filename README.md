# django3-persoport
This was in the works while I was learning python before I made the switch over to javascript. The website is mostly working, except for the images which I likely will not go back to fix at this point, but it's fun to see where I started,and how different the project compares to now.
As to why I'm not going back to fix the image issue, I simply don't plan on useing the website, and I enjoy the cutomization options from css and javascript much  more.
